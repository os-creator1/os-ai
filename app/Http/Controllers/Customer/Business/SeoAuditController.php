/**
 * Contract 18 Sub-slice G — the Website SEO / technical audit surface.
 *
 * REPORT-ONLY. It shows findings the audit already computed from the
 * immutable published snapshot and lets the customer ask for a re-run. It
 * writes nothing to `websites`, `website_pages`, `website_revisions` or
 * `website_assets` (§12.1), fetches no URL, runs no crawler and calls no AI
 * or provider. There is no auto-fix: a finding links to the existing Website
 * page editor, where the customer edits and publishes through Website's own
 * authorization, unchanged (§8.7).
 *
 * The chain (§10.1): Workspace by uid -> Business inside it ->
 * userCanAccessBusiness() -> Business Active -> the entitlement decision for
 * PlatformFeature::SeoModule -> the capability gate (`view_seo` to read,
 * `manage_seo` to re-run). Every mismatch is `abort(404)`, never 403, and no
 * implicit route-model binding is used.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED WHILE `Planned`. SeoModule is Planned until Sub-slice H, so
 * every route here answers 404 today.

     * already-audited revision converges on the existing run instead of
     * duplicating it — so this button is safe to press repeatedly and cannot

     * is the database UNIQUE key above; this only stops one actor pushing
     * repeated queue work for one Business. It is therefore keyed by ACTOR
     * AND BUSINESS, never globally: one Business (or one impatient user)
     * must never be able to block another's re-run.
     *
     * It is also consumed LAST. Tenancy, entitlement and the capability gate
     * all run first, so an unauthorized or unentitled request is refused
     * without ever touching the limiter — otherwise a stranger's 404s could
     * burn the real customer's cooldown.
